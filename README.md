ToyLanguage Interpreter
The idea of this project is to create an interpreter for a new programming language, ToyLanguage.
The purpose of this project was to make a brief analysis of how things work behind the execution of a program.

Toy Language Description:
A program (Prg) in this language consists of a statement (Stmt) as follows:
Prg := Stmt where the symbol "::=" means "a Prg is defined as a Stmt".
A statement can be either a compound statement (CompStmt), or an assignment statement
(AssignStmt), or a print statement (PrintStmt), or a conditional statement (IfStmt) as follows:
Stmt ::= Stmt1 ; Stmt2 /* (CompStmt)*/
 | Id = Exp /* (AssignStmt)*/
 | Print(Exp) /* (PrintStmt)*/
 | If Expr Then Stmt1 Else Stmt2 /* (IfStmt)*/
where the symbol "|" denotes the possible definition alternatives.

An expression (Exp) can be either an integer number (Const), or a variable name (Var), or an
arithmetic expression (ArithExp) as follows:
Exp ::= Number /*(Const)*/
 | Id /*(Var)*/
 | Exp1 + Exp2 /*(ArithExp)*/
 | Exp1 - Exp2
 | Exp1 * Exp2
 | Exp1 / Exp2
where Number denotes an integer constant, and Id denotes a variable name.

Example1:
 v=2;
Print(v)

Example2:
a=2+3*5;
b=a-4/2 + 7;
Print(b)

Example3:
a=2-2;
If a Then v=2 Else v=3;
Print(v)

Toy Language Execution:
Our mini interpreter uses three main structures:
– Execution Stack (ExeStack): a stack of statements to execute the currrent program
– Table of Symbols (SymTable): a table which keeps the variables values
– Output (Out): that keeps all the mesages printed by the toy program

All these three main structures denote the given program state (PrgState). Our interpreter
can execute multiple programs but for each of them use a different PrgState (that means
different ExeStack, SymTable and Out structures).
At the beginning ExeStack contains the orginal program, and SymTable and Out are empty.
After the evaluation has started ExeStack contains the remaining part of the program that
must be evaluated, SymTable contains the variables (from the assignment statements
evaluated so far) with their assigned values, and Out contains the values printed so far.
In order to explain the program evaluation rules, we represent ExeStack as a collection of
statements separated by the symbol "|", SymTable as a collection of mappings and Out as a
collection of messages.
For example the ExeStack {s1 | s2 | s3} denotes a stack that has the statement s1 on top of it,
then the statement s2 and at the bottom of the stack is the statement s3.
For example SymTable {v->2,a->4} denotes the table containing only two variables v and a, v
has been assigned the value 2 while a has been assigned the value 4.
For example Out {1,2} denotes the printed values, the order of printing is 2 followed by 1.

At the end of a program evaluation ExeStack is empty, SymTable contains all the program
variables, and Out contains all the program print outputs.
Statement Evaluation Rules: are described by presenting the program state
(ExeStack1,SymTable1,Out1) before applying the evaluation rule, the symbol "==>" for one
step evaluation and the program state (ExeStack2,SymTable2,Out2) after applying the
evaluation rule. Each evaluation rules shows how the program state is changed. One step 
evaluation means that only one statement evaluation rule is applied. Complete evaluation
means that all possible evaluation rules are applied until the program evaluation terminates.


S1. CompStmt evaluation: when a compound statement is the top of the ExeStack
ExeStack1={Stmt1;Stmt2 | Stmt3|....}
SymTable1
Out1
 ==>
ExeStack1={Stmt1| Stmt2 | Stmt3|.....}
SymTable2=SymTable1
Out2 = Out1
As you can see the top of the ExeStack is changed while SymTable and Out remain
unchanged.

S2. AssignStmt evaluation: an assignment statement is on top of the stack
ExeStack1={Id=Exp| Stmt1|....}
SymTable1
Out1
 ==>
ExeStack1={Stmt1|...}
SymTable2=SymTable1 U {Id->Eval(Exp)}
Out2 = Out1
where Eval(Exp) denotes the expression evaluation and the rules are explained a bit later.
The symbol "U" denotes the union of two collections.

S3. PrintStmt evaluation
ExeStack1={Print(Exp)| Stmt1|....}
SymTable1
Out1
 ==>
ExeStack1={Stmt1|...}
SymTable2=SymTable1
Out2 = Out1 U {Eval(Exp)}

S4. IfStmt evaluation
ExeStack1={If Exp Then Stmt1 Else Stmt2 | Stmt3|....}
SymTable1
Out1
 ==>
if Eval(Exp)!=0 ExeStack1={Stmt1|Stmt3|...} else ExeStack1={Stmt2|Stmt3|...}
SymTable2=SymTable1
Out2 = Out1

S5. Program termination
ExeStack ={}
SymTable
Out
==>
end of the program evaluation


Expression evaluation rules are presented using recursive rules. These rules do not change the
program state:

E1. Const Evaluation:
Eval(Number) = Number
the constant is returned by evaluation

E2. Var Evaluation:
Eval(Id) = LookUp(SymTable,Id)
where LookUp(SymTable,Id) returns the value which is mapped to the variable Id. If the
variable Id does not exist in SymTable LookUp returns an exception.

Examples:
LookUp({a->2,b->3},a)=2
LookUp({a->2,b->3},x) raised the exception "variable x is not defined"

E3. ArithExp evaluation:
Eval(Exp1 + Exp2)= Eval(Exp1) + Eval(Exp2)
Eval(Exp1 - Exp2)= Eval(Exp1) - Eval(Exp2)
Eval(Exp1 * Exp2)= Eval(Exp1) * Eval(Exp2)
Eval(Exp1 / Exp2)= Eval(Exp1) / Eval(Exp2)

First left operand and right operand are evaluated to values. Then those two values are
combined by the arithmethic operator (+,-,* or /) and the final value is computed.
